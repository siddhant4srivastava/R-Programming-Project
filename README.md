This repository showcases the R projects completed as part of my training with **Edvancer Eduventures**, where I honed my data science and machine learning skills. Each project demonstrates real-world problem-solving using various statistical and machine learning techniques, along with the effective use of R for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
